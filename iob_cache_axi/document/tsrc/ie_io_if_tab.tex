invalidate\_i & input & 1 & Invalidates all cache lines instantaneously if high. \\* \nobreakhline
\rowcolor{iob-blue}
invalidate\_o & output & 1 & This output is asserted high when the cache is invalidated via the cache controller or the direct 'invalidate\_in' signal. The present 'invalidate\_out' signal is useful for invalidating the next-level cache if there is one. If not, this output should be floated. \\* \nobreakhline
wtb\_empty\_i & input & 1 & This input is driven by the next-level cache, if there is one, when its write-through buffer is empty. It should be tied high if there is no next-level cache. This signal is used to compute the overall empty status of a cache hierarchy, as explained for signal 'wtb\_empty\_out'. \\* \nobreakhline
\rowcolor{iob-blue}
wtb\_empty\_o & output & 1 & This output is high if the cache's write-through buffer is empty and its 'wtb\_empty\_in' signal is high. This signal informs that all data written to the cache has been written to the destination memory module, and all caches on the way are empty. \\
