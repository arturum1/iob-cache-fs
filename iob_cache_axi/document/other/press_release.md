# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

## IObundle Promotes IOb-Cache: Premier Open-Source Cache System for AI/ML Memory Bottlenecks

**Lisbon, Portugal – February 17, 2026** – IObundle, Lda announces the promotion of IOb-Cache, the industry's most advanced open-source cache IP core. After significant recent enhancements, this proven, peer-reviewed cache system is positioned as the essential solution for addressing memory access challenges in modern AI and machine learning applications.

### Best-in-Class Open-Source Cache Architecture

IOb-Cache stands alone as the most comprehensive open-source cache system available, offering capabilities typically found only in proprietary solutions. The core provides complete support for multiple replacement policies and configurable write policies (write-through/not-allocate and write-back/allocate), making it the go-to choice for performance-critical applications.

Published in the peer-reviewed journal Algorithms (2021), IOb-Cache has been continuously refined and improved, incorporating lessons from real-world deployments and community feedback.

### Addressing the Memory Wall in AI/ML Workloads

As artificial intelligence and machine learning applications push computational boundaries, memory access has emerged as the primary performance bottleneck. IOb-Cache directly addresses this critical challenge by providing:

- **High-Performance Pipeline Architecture**: One request per clock cycle (read and write)
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adjustable ways, address width, line size, and words per line
- **Advanced Policies**: Configurable replacement strategies for optimal hit rates
- **Dual Write Modes**: Choose between write-through and write-back based on workload
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in cache-control module for measurement and optimization

### Production-Ready with Modern Integration

IOb-Cache features comprehensive support for modern hardware development workflows:

- **Multiple Backend Interfaces**: Both Native IOb (pipelined) and AXI4 support
- **Py2hwsw Integration**: Python-based framework for seamless SoC adoption
- **FuseSoC Compatible**: Pre-built releases available for immediate deployment
- **Proven Reliability**: Successfully deployed in multiple production systems
- **Complete Documentation**: User guide and integration examples included

### Technical Excellence Meets Open Source

"Memory access efficiency is the make-or-break factor in today's AI and ML systems," said a spokesperson for IObundle. "IOb-Cache provides the sophisticated caching capabilities these applications demand, with the flexibility and transparency that only open source can deliver. It's the most advanced cache system available in the open-source hardware community."

The core's configurability allows developers to optimize for their specific use cases, from embedded systems to high-performance computing applications. The recent improvements have enhanced reliability, expanded configuration options, and improved synthesis results across multiple FPGA platforms.

### Open Source with Permissive Licensing

IOb-Cache is released under the permissive MIT License, enabling unrestricted use in commercial and non-commercial projects. The complete source code, peer-reviewed documentation, and integration framework are available on GitHub.

### Availability

IOb-Cache is immediately available for download from the IObundle GitHub repository at https://github.com/IObundle/iob-cache. The repository includes complete Verilog source code, comprehensive documentation, FuseSoC-compatible pre-built releases, and the Py2hwsw integration framework.
