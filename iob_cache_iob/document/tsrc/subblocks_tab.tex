iob\_cache\_front\_end & front\_end & This IOb interface is connected to a processor or any other processing element that needs a cache buffer to improve the performance of accessing a slower but larger memory \\ \hline
\rowcolor{iob-blue}
iob\_cache\_memory & cache\_memory & This block contains the tag, data storage memories and the Write Through Buffer if the correspeonding write policy is selected; these memories are implemented either with RAM if large enough, or with registers if small enough \\ \hline
iob\_cache\_back\_end\_iob & back\_end\_iob & Memory-side interface: if the cache is at the last level before the target memory module, the back-end interface connects to the target memory (e.g. DDR) controller; if the cache is not at the last level, the back-end interface connects to the next-level cache. This module implements an IOb interface \\ \hline
